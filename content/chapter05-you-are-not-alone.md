\cleanchapterquote{Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to disposes and to malign. But, stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that dignity.}{Chimamanda Adichei}{2009} 


In the last two chapters we saw examples of mental health activists whose advocacy shifted from challenging the existence of mental illness to demanding a role in the production of psychiatric knowledge and greater control over narrating their own stories. We saw how non-credentialed mental health activists were silenced and marginalized by mental health professionals at Occupy Wall Street and by the psychiatrists who made up the APA's Radical Caucus. The mainstream mental health establishment demonstrates even less regard for activists' concerns, rarely acknowledging their existence, never mind respecting their viewpoint. In this chapter we will explore what these activists would say if they more carefully articulated their views and treatment recommendations, and why their own perspectives and vernaculars matter. In particular, we will closely examine an organization at the forefront of the mad movement's transformation---The Icarus Project.

In the first decade of the 21st century, mental health activists reinvented the psychiatric survivor movement through a series of strategic overtures that borrowed from participatory culture and the possibilities opened up by communications technologies. This freshly reconstituted field of resistance to biopsychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry formed at a moment when networked actors sought collective empowerment and forged authentic connections in virtual spaces. These communities formed against the backdrop of an unprecedented expansion in psychiatric diagnosis and treatment, and at the intersection of the emergence of a more participatory internet, dubbed "Web 2.0" (O'Reilly, 2005), and a trend within social movements demanding greater inclusion (Kavada, 2013).

During this period The Icarus Project developed hybrid models of peer-support and direct action that were, at times, accelerated and amplified, and at times overwhelmed and thwarted, by the proliferation of new communicative possibilities. The Icarus Project runs an independent community website with active blogs and forums; it publishes newsletters, articles, books, flyers, stickers, apparel, artwork, music and video; its facilitates mailing lists, social media and community conference calls; and, it organizes and hosts events, peer-support groups, and workshops. The project freely licensed all of their digital and print materials, and originally mobilized around free and open-source software (FOSS), and later, proprietary social media.

The collective leadership has strived to create a participatory architecture supporting their commitments to access, advocacy, transparency, engagement and community building. These attempts were not always successful, and the project continues to grow in fits and starts, even a decade after its creation. The Icarus Project long has grappled with organizational instability, a bewildering proliferation of platforms and communication channels, internal conflict and unrest, and a deep ambivalence about digital interactions. These tumultuous organizational dynamics mirror the precarious emotional lives of its membership, and the project's perseverance is a testament to its resilience and the deep resonance of its messaging. At various times, the national collective or local chapters have stalled in the face of paralyzing organizational and communicative dysfunction, only to reboot with a fresh influx of members, energy, and, occasionally, funding.

For over a decade The Icarus Project has generated and facilitated publications, conversations and events across a wide array of media platforms. All of this activity warrants close study in order to synthesize an understanding of the project's core beliefs. What did they say? How, if at all, can we weave their disparate strands of discourse into a coherent narrative? The project's history, culture and ideology provide us with important indications for how they believe mental health should be discussed and supported. The language and tactics they have cultivated suggest alternatives that can be adopted on a much larger scale.

The Icarus Project conducts much of its discourse within peer-support groups, either face-to-face or online. These conversations are understood as safe spaces and are largely outside the boundaries of ethical ethnographic research. Accordingly, my analysis of the project focuses primarily on published media, communications infrastructure, and representative public projects and controversies that illustrate the way _Icaristas_, as members affectionately call each other, think and act. These snapshots are as diverse and fragmented as the project itself, and together provide a holistic perspective of the organization's identity and values.

My selection of these discursive snapshots is based on my direct participation within the organization as well as numerous conversations and interviews since I began working with this project in 2005. In the next chapter I detail my introduction to the project and my personal involvement as an activist and organizer. My involvement included providing technical consulting and maintenance, participating in New York City support groups, strategic consulting for the national collective, and organizing public campaigns and events. My direct participation provides me with a unique vantage point for gathering primary sources, navigating convoluted histories, and critiquing the project, as a participant-observer.

#Preamble: Friends make the best medicine#

In 2002 Sascha "Scatter" DuBrul published a first-person narrative in the San Francisco Bay Guardian about his "poly-polar" experiences (DuBrul, 2002). He shares his intensely personal history of radical ideas, exhilarating states of mind, and eccentric, often dangerous, behaviors. He boldly came out of the mad closet, disclosing his psychiatric diagnosis, and recounted his history of repeated institutionalizations and over-medication. DuBrul's narrative about himself contained strong currents of social criticism (and heroism), and he contextualizes his own inner psychological struggles within the external reality of society's political struggles. Finally, he shares how psychiatry's labels make him feel, introducing us to the importance of struggles over language and framing:

>But I feel so alienated sometimes, even by the language I find coming out of my mouth or that I type out on the computer screen. Words like "disorder," "disease," and "dysfunction" just seem so very hollow and crude. I feel like I'm speaking a foreign and clinical language that is useful for navigating my way though the current system but doesn't translate into my own internal vocabulary, where things are so much more fluid and complex. (DuBrul, 2002)

_Bipolar World_ is not a traditional manifesto, but can be read as a form of what I call "narrative advocacy", a statement that blends intensely personal narratives, framed in the storyteller's language, with persuasive arguments that engage and resist dominant mainstream narratives. In _Bipolar World,_ DuBrul begins to recognize the power inherent in the language used to tell a story, and the implicit control that narrators exert over the language, metaphors, and imagery they invoke. The power he exercises through the deliberate choice of language for describing his history and condition, and his inclusions and exculsions, has been analyzed and explored in the classic discourse around "framing" in sociology and media studies (Goffman, 1974), and is a central problematic for Disability Studies (Davis, 1997) and the burgeoning discipline of Narrative Medicine (Charon, 2002; Lewis, 2011). This choice of language determines how seemingly objective facts are infused with value and meaning, as I considered in the introduction.

In the documentary film _Crooked Beauty_ (Rosenthal, 2010a)_,_ Jacks Ashley McNamara retells their (Jacks prefers the pronouns 'they/them') initial encounter with DuBrul's story, replying with their own story, and recounting their dream of creating safe spaces for the exchange of stories, both in person and online:

>I met Sascha because I had responded to a version of his life story that he had written and got published... about his experiences with madness, quote unquote, and wanting to live an authentic adventurous life and not crash and burn over and over because of the fragile fire in his brain. I ended up sending him my whole life story and he showed me all these emails he had been getting from people all over the country... he and I decided that there had to be a place for these people to read each other's stories and to know that they existed. And so we thought we would start up a website. It became The Icarus Project and it had way more than just a few stories, it became an interactive forum for people to talk to each other. And, just grew and mushroomed into this whole network of people all over the country. (Rosenthal, 2010b)

The Icarus Project was born, then, in the nexus of two stories and expanded into a galaxy of networked storytellers –sharing, exchanging, generating meaningful wisdom and authentic narratives, spawning a pidgin language of empowerment and resistance in the process. These encounters were rarely simple. Local communities ebbed and flowed, often starting in a burst of exuberant enthusiasm, only to implode and collapse under the stressful demands of organizing, compounded by the emotional weight of peer support.

The Icarus Project has achieved great success, positively impacting tens of thousands of people, and by many accounts, saving numerous lives. Throughout its existence, Icarus has also grappled with the problem maintaining resilience: (a) at the individual level of its membership facing the demons of heightened sensitivity and relapse; (b) at the local group level, as groups struggled for stability, combating burnout and struggling to maintain the capacity to listen and support each other through crisis; (c) online, with continuity often challenged as interlocutors arrived and disappeared without notice, and flamewars regularly erupted; and, (d) at the national level, as the national collective struggled with finances, governance models, internal strife, power dynamics, its relationship with local groups and organizer fatigue.

>Distinct patterns of dysfunction have emerged, and although the project's leadership has recognized many, they have proven difficult to break. For example, groups with the best intensions often discover they do not have the time, training or emotional capacity to support members in crisis. Some peer-support groups have fallen apart shouldering more responsibility than they could handle, and the pressures of supporting members has precipitated emotional chain reactions. Another example of a dysfunctional pattern is the predictable burnout of volunteer group facilitators. Peer-support facilitators typically bear the brunt of organizing responsibility. Groups often start out with multiple facilitators, but facilitators inevitably drop out, leaving an overwhelming responsibility on one person's shoulders. Eventually, the last facilitator succumbs to the pressure, and the group terminates when they quit.

Some of these problems could be addressed with additional resources, although others suggest inherent flaws in the support models. Throughout this turmoil the project successfully built a cohesive community, one that fulfilled the project's mission statement:

>The Icarus Project envisions a new culture and language that resonates with our actual experiences of 'mental illness' rather than trying to fit our lives into a conventional framework. We are a network of people living with and/or affected by experiences that are often diagnosed and labeled as psychiatric conditions. We believe these experiences are mad gifts needing cultivation and care, rather than diseases or disorders. By joining together as individuals and as a community, the intertwined threads of madness, creativity, and collaboration can inspire hope and transformation in an oppressive and damaged world. Participation in The Icarus Project helps us overcome alienation and tap into the true potential that lies between brilliance and madness. (The Icarus Project, 2006b)

One important aspect of the project that distinguished it from prior efforts was an understanding of the significance of fostering solidarity around subjective, first-person narratives, and the relevance of these stories to resistance and healing. The Project began to explore a liminal space between peer-support and activism. Traditionally, peer-support groups are private and introverted, and activism is public and extroverted. A tension exists between the quieter safe-spaces a peer-support group needs, and the louder provocative spaces that activists often intrude or agitate.

Icaristas developed a strategy to balance the competing demands of peer-support and activism by focusing on the relationships between personal suffering and the conditions of structural violence and injustice in the world. Personal struggles were understood in sociopolitical contexts, and individual dysfunction was traced to larger social systems of dysfunction that individuals were embedded in. Icaristas emphasized psychosocial explanations for emotional suffering and crisis, especially among those who exhibit "heightened sensitivities". They resist the prevailing "bio-bio-bio" model of explanation that neglects accounts of poverty, racism, intergenerational trauma and other forms of oppression in understanding the human condition. Simultaneously, these explanations never outright denied the influence of biology or an individual's personal responsibility for their behavior. The problems were not exclusively "out there" nor were they exclusively the product of what transpired inside someone's skull. The project attempted to embrace the non-deterministic interaction between nature and nurture, while incorporating a sociopolitical critique that aimed to hold institutions and states accountable alongside individuals.

By emphasizing the direct connections between social injustice and personal trauma, many Icaristasdiscovered the benefits of treating activism as a "therapeutic substrate", finding tremendous value in the communal bonds that activism fosters. The phrase "therapeutic substrate" is meant to capture a psychological mechanism for working through personal issues by operating on similar issues, displaced onto an abstracted or symbolic terrain. I interacted with many Icaristas whose participation in activism around mental health issues provides an outlet for integrating disparate elements in their worlds---a way for their closeted mad identity and their public persona to converge. Mental health activism opens up a space for them to discuss mental heath without divulging their own experiences directly. Talking about mental health issues helps reduce the stigma around the topic, and enables activists to broach these topics from a position of relative power, within an activist movement, rather than as a vulnerable individual. Safe communal spaces encourage people to "come out" and tell their personal stories. Beyond the boundaries of the project's safe spaces, many Icaristas continue to engage publically with political mental health issues without necessarily disclosing their personal psychiatric history. Their involvement in public discourses resists the monoculture of psychiatric knowledge production, and incorporates a diversity of perspectives that are ordinarily silenced by stigma.

McNamara recalls that, early on, the Icarus Project "had some vague idea that, a key piece of recovering mental health had to do with building community... [and] becoming willing to trust other people on the planet." (Rosenthal, 2010b) The website, peer-support groups, activist campaigns, media publishing, art and music shows, and events all became ways for people to come together. At their best, they came together in solidarity, forged friendships, and learned that they were not alone. At their worst, participants emotionally overextended themselves, sabotaged relationships, and become unwell. Yet, I never met anyone who wished that they had never encountered Icarus, or felt that their investment was wasted. In fact, I met many who claimed that encountering Icarus materials, and joining a likeminded community had saved their lives. The intensity of interactions, with either positive or negative valences, left a memorable impact on almost everyone who passed through the project. Even those who grew disillusioned with the project's current form emerged with a newfound commitment to "overcome alienation" and "inspir[e] hope and transformation" in the world. The project's visions and aspirations were always grander than its ability to follow through, but the membership continues to pursue these dreams, and motivate others to follow.

Unlike many in the previous generation of psychiatric survivors, Icarus refused to dogmatically condemn or judge anyone's _informed_ treatment choices. Informed consent is a difficult standard to meet, since accurate information is hard to find amidst the sea of Pharma's marketing and spin, and 'consent' is violated in cases of coercion and forced treatment. 'Consent' is also questionable in the context of treating children, prisoners, seniors in nursing homes, and other populations without full agency. However, in the case of free, informed, consenting adults, Icarus chooses to deeply respect an individual's choices regarding medication and self-identification. This acceptance stands in stark contrast to many elements of the anti-psychiatry and psychiatric survivor movements, who outright deny the existence of mental illness, and dismiss psychiatry and psychiatric labels and treatments. In this sense, the psychiatric survivor movement is guilty of committing an offence similar to that of the psychiatric establishment, by dictating to others how they should think and feel. The more extreme contingents of the old guard maintain that anyone who finds solace or support in psychiatric drugs or labels is being deceived, challenging the agency and self-definition that characterizes the new wave of mad resistance. Some Icaristas I met felt that the denial of mental illness negated their suffering and amounted to an "ableist" claim leveled by those who were high functioning against those who experienced disabilities.

In contrast, The Icarus Project aims to create safe spaces for people to share their subjective narratives: spaces where people could teach each other how to "navigate the space between brilliance and madness." The project aspires to be inclusive, welcoming those who take or refuse psychotropic medications, as well as proponents of alternative wellness plans. The project makes a crucial distinction between a strong stance for (or against) an individual's informed choices regarding pharmaceutical treatment, and a critique of the psychiatric establishment and the pharmaceutical industry. This distinction opens the space for them to embrace members who choose to take psychiatric drugs and accept their psychiatric labels, and still unite in their exploration of alternatives, their critique of psychiatry's abuses, and their opposition to the predatory practices of the industry. Their critique goes beyond the minority of psychiatrists, like those we met in Chapter 4, who are also critical of greedy pharmaceutical companies and widespread over diagnosis and overmedication. Their original mistrust was rooted in anarchist politics that mistrusted capitalism, consumerism, and "The Man". Beyond the simple account of Pharma's greedy profit motives, many _Icaristas_ believe the stigma around mental illness feeds the isolation and alienation that, in turn, perpetuates and propels the capitalist system.

As the project evolved, its membership refined their critique, as they became informed by the history of the mad movement, critical theory, and their interactions with students, academics, and experienced activists. Over time, Icaristas have downplayed some of the language that defined the project in its early years. Some have backed away from identifying themselves as part of the "Mad Pride" movement, as they called into question taking "pride" in negative states and behaviors, such as aggression or self-harm. They have also backed away from their original slogan, "Navigating the space between brilliance and madness", the title of the project's original publication. Icaristas have become more sensitive to those who do not characterize their mad journeys as "brilliant", and who feel alienated by the elitism of a slogan that dismisses "mediocre" madness. The project has also undertaken a major "decolonization" effort, in the hopes of extending its membership to minorities and the poor. Finally, Icarus continues to develop its understanding of accountability in altered states, a complex ethical question that troubles and perplexes the membership.

The Icarus Project evolved with a critical self-awareness of its own structures and processes. Deliberate efforts were made by the collective to model the kinds of power relations within the project that the membership desired to see in the world around them. These efforts sometimes fell flat, and the project progressed in punctuated bursts. Tensions between the online community, local chapters (who often did not engage in the online support forums) and the national organizers regularly threatened the project's coherence. The national organizers devoted so much energy to developing internal process that they were often accused of navel-gazing. They believed that a well- articulated governance model was crucial among "mad folk", especially important in accommodating extreme moods and heightened sensitivities. However, despite the leadership's best intensions, decision-making and accountability remained ambiguous throughout the project's history. They clung to an anarchist-inspired consensus-based decision model, but transparency and lines of communication were often muddled. Some decisions seemed unilateral, while others stalled in indecisive purgatory. The online community, largely composed of membership living in places where there was no local group, often complained that their needs were neglected. The national organizers often neglected the online spaces, and focused on organizing in-person groups and events. Local groups operated autonomously, and were often outside the loop of national's decisions and planning. The constituents were largely self-aware of these shortcomings, and regularly focused on trying to improve communication and trust, however progress was slow due to fuzzy goals, expansive scope and organizational turnover. In spite of these dysfunctions, the project has endured, experimenting with different governance models, and continuing to function and grow.

In 2004, DuBrul and McNamara, fresh with an infusion of private funding, stepped back from their roles as co-founders and joined a larger collective that guided the project. The project's founding principles explicitly embrace consensus-driven, non-hierarchical, transparent decision-making – across the project's governance, autonomous local collectives, and within peer-support groups. These principles also endorse non-violence, respect for diversity, anti-oppression, and access across identities, abilities, and class. DuBrul describes their 2005 mission statement as follows:

>These were revolutionary words and acknowledged our relationship to history and our debt to the movements and cultural workers that had come before us. These words put us outside all the other organizations working in our field. They acknowledged to us and everyone else that we were taking a radical stance in the true meaning of radical: from the roots to the extremes. No one else in the field of mental health was talking about non-hierarchy and transparency the way we were. We were bringing the radical narratives and models into the door of the mainstream. (DuBrul, 2012)

When DuBrul talks about radical, 'from the roots to the extremes', he means the project's ideas about mental health are radical, as well as their governance and processes. The organization he dreamt about was radical to the core, from its mission, to its organization and operations. The principles are echoed and embodied in the meeting agreements, which are collectively read at the beginning of all Icarus peer-support meetings. The preamble begins with a variation of the mission statement and then continues:

> ... This is a space for people to come together and learn from each others' different views and experiences of madness. People who take psychiatric drugs are welcome here, as are people who don't take psychiatric drugs. People who use diagnosis categories to describe themselves are welcome, as are people who define themselves differently. The Icarus Project values self-determination and mutual support... (The Icarus Project, 2006a)

The meeting agreements include basic actionable guidelines to "ensure inclusion, safety, and open dialog". The agreements specify practices such as: (a) "listening like allies", where peers are encouraged to adopt an empathetic stance, as opposed to a contrarian or adversarial one. In practice, this guideline is used to gently redirect feedback that is perceived as overly harsh or critical; (b) "stepping up, stepping back", a guideline encouraging quiet participants to speak up, and loud participants to give others a chance to speak. Good facilitators invoke this guideline to encourage shy or otherwise intimated participants to speak, and to try to contain willful personalities from dominating the conversation. This guideline is also invoked to provide typically marginalized participants, including women and minorities, a chance to set agendas and kick off discussions; (c) "practicing owl vision", a guideline intended to empower all of the participants to be mindful of the group's dynamics, and take collective responsibility for enforcing the guidelines without relying exclusively the facilitator; (d) "challenging prejudice", the meeting agreements explicitly acknowledge the group's commitment to eradicating social injustice, and affirm the connection of prejudice to emotional distress; (e) "respecting beliefs outside the mainstream", this agreement directly challenges the psychiatric medicalization of strange, nonconsensual beliefs. Provided they are non-violent and non-oppressive, participants agree not to judge spiritual, religious, conspiratorial, paranormal and other non-conventional beliefs that do not conform with the mainstream. Upholding this agreement is often fraught, since many non-consensual belief systems (e.g., conspiracy theories) contain seeds of oppression, and this also includes acceptance of alternative approaches to physical and mental health; (f) "using 'I' statements", a central, foundational agreement meant to steer people away from abstractions, generalizations, and so-called 'violent communication' (Rosenberg, 2003). 'Speaking from the I' helps avoid lecturing, grandstanding, and formulating statements in ways that are likely to antagonize others with different perspectives. Participants in Icarus groups regularly correct each other's speech by gently reminding them to speak from the 'I', just as a _Jeopardy!_ contestant is reminded to re-state their answer in the form of a question; (g) "paying attention to repeating patterns", This agreement is more difficult to attend to, as it implies a continuity between groups that is not always present. Good facilitators have tried to take this into account, and steer conversations to people's issues who have not received recent attention, and try to avoid recurring personality conflicts. However, confronting repeating patterns is arguably one of the reasons participants are attending peer-support groups. This agreement acknowledges that it can be difficult to notice repeating patterns, never mind disrupt them; and (h) "respecting confidentiality", an essential component of a safe space. In practice, this agreement is ambiguous, since peer support meetings sometimes meet in semi-public spaces, have fluctuating attendees, and are often hybrid support and organizing meetings, with the expectation that the organizing notes will be shared publically. Topics resurface in meetings where new people are present and the original participants are not. Some groups interpret confidentiality to mean protecting people's identities, while others are adamant that even the stories told in groups should not be shared with outsiders. For these reasons, groups are encouraged to clarify their intent around confidentiality.

The Icarus meeting agreements build on a history of activist meeting agreements, and extend them with a powerful template that should be widely adopted to other settings outside of mental health advocacy. These agreements are direct extensions of the project's core values that manage to effectively distill highbrow social theory by embodying it in day-to-day practice. In particular, encouraging everyone to "speak from the 'I'" helps minimize broad generalizations and the imposition of one person's beliefs onto someone else's identity. The meeting agreements reiterate the group's belief in autonomy and self-determination and reinforce the belief that all of us are the ultimate authority on our own well-being.

Even with these sophisticated agreements in place, facilitating an Icarus peer-support is a stressful and exhausting responsibility. Icarus peer-support groups are notorious for forming in a burst of exuberant energy, and dissolving or imploding within a year. In practice, Icarus groups have struggled to enforce the meeting agreements, as one or two obstinate individuals can threaten a group's stability. Individuals have been asked to take a break from a groups, and on rare occasions people have been banned from groups, however, without clear boundaries, the process of asking someone to leave is fraught with politics and nearly impossible to enforce. The combination of heightened sensitivities and spirited energies, often crossed with wide differences in participant's age and class, creates volatile conditions for intimacy. Icarus groups have never established firm accountability guidelines, and it has historically been difficult to address conflicts that arise in groups.

For example, I once participated in a group where a participant refused to introduce himself along with his preferred gender pronoun. Like many other groups who attempt to create a welcoming atmosphere for queer participants, Icarus checkins typically begin with the participant introducing their name, followed by their preferred gender pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, ze/zir). This introduction is intended to make all participants feel welcome and comfortable, since having everyone specify their preferred pronoun avoids drawing attention to those who feel they need to clarify their own. For reasons he never articulated, one participant was unwilling to include his preferred pronoun in his introduction, making the larger group uncomfortable. The facilitator was at a loss for how to handle his defiance, and he continued to attend the meetings until he eventually dropped out, on his own accord, a few weeks later.

Similarly, I have been a part of many support meetings where one participant has dominated the conversation, despite the agreement to "step up, step back". Local groups have developed various protocols for asking participants to take a break from the group, but conflicts recur. By their nature, support groups often draw participants who are in various emotional states, and a significant challenge of the model is trying to figure out ways to attract and retain participants who are in a relatively stable place, instead of only showing up to a peer support group while experiencing a extreme emotional crisis.

Unsurprisingly, financial resources help stabilize support groups. Many groups struggle to find a meeting location, especially since many are uncomfortable in clinical spaces, such as hospitals. A small funding stream can secure suitable non-profit meetings spaces and light refreshments. Similarly, providing a salary for facilitators also improves the stability of the group. However, the challenges with The Icarus peer-support model likely extend beyond financial constraints. Building an authentic community is challenging work, and there is no formula for fabricating friendships. Some groups found that by organizing social events instead of peer-support groups they forged more genuine bonds. Others have proposed exploring a one-on-one sponsor model, similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, although no Icarus chapter has tried this yet.

Many of the healthy, longer-running Icarus peer-support groups have been composed of a small number of regular participants (3-5), instead of a larger, fluctuating participant pool. A sustained commitment over time and continuity between groups has proven essential for forging intimate bonds and authentic relationships. In recognition of these dynamics, some local groups have experimented with capping the number of participants in their groups. Some have even defined a finite duration of the group (e.g., 6 or 8 months), as opposed to an open-ended engagement. This limited horizon is meant to address the inevitable power dynamics that may ossify within a fixed pool of supporters. These models are promising, and some Icaristas have talked about developing matching systems to help interested participants find a compatible Icarus "cell". On the surface, closed groups sound antithetical to the group's anarchist tendencies, but an open network of closed groups is more compatible, and could provide essential continuity to the organization over time.

It is unclear if the project's failure to sustain peer-support groups over the long term represents a flaw in the model, the execution, or a combination of the two. What is clear is that the membership continues to be drawn towards peer-support, clinging to the idea and persevering in the face of repeated failures. In what may sound like a rose-colored interpretation, I believe these adaptations illustrate the project's fluid resilience, and not merely stubbornness, or simply history repeating itself. When the project reaches an impasse, it morphs and adapts to new circumstances, circumventing breakdown through creative reinventions. Some Icaristas give up and move on to other projects, taking with them the lessons they have learned, and often, lifelong friendships. Others continue to devote themselves to the project, tenaciously iterating, and struggling to improve upon models and processes.

Historically, grassroots organizing has been plagued by cycles of intense activity followed by disruptive burnout. The core constituency of the The Icarus Project tends to amplify these dynamics since many of the participants exhibit behaviors that exacerbate these patterns. The activists attracted to the project at times exhibit aggressive, overbearing and self-centered behaviors, and at other times withdrawn, submissive and self-deprecating ones. These behaviors are common among activists, but magnified among people who struggle with altered states. Grassroots organizing is difficult in any context, and the challenges around organizing within communities that are struggling with deep trauma, emotional crises and neurological diversity amplifies and exaggerates these challenges. Icarus organizers are prone to inadvertently stumble upon each other's "triggers", as one person's madness (e.g., excessive interruptions or yelling) exacerbates another's sensitivities (e.g., a history of bullying or abuse).

The project's day-to-day conflicts and long-term dysfunction are obstructive to their goal of manifesting solidarity. At the same time, this dysfunction creates a fertile ground for developing new languages, instigated by provocations that engage and intrigue its membership. In her recent dissertation, Erica Fletcher, a doctoral candidate at the Institute for the Medical Humanities at the University of Texas Medical Branch, has argued that the project's resilience, best understood as a function of its romantic aesthetic and heroic narrative, has maintained a strong sense of solidarity in spite of its dysfunction (2015). Fletcher's in depth ethnographic critique profiles the project's reliance on digital communication technologies, such as mailing lists, discussion boards and collaboration tools, that continually disappoint due to misuse, obsolescence, and "bitrot" (digital corrosion). These technological letdowns parallel the members' anticipation of their own personal and psychological collapses, and provide essential insights to the inner workings, and failings, of Icarus throughout its history.

In the following snapshots I focus on the ways that the project publically articulates its vision, and how this vision is sometimes realized.

#Discursive snapshots#

##Crooked Beauty##

In 2010 Ken Rosenthal released a documentary film featuring Jacks Ashley McNamara, the co-founder of The Icarus Project (Rosenthal, 2010). Crooked Beauty artfully captures many essential aspects of the project's core message, and has been used regularly in Icarus-led presentations and workshops. Alongside _Navigating the Space_, the original graphic novel that DuBrul and McNamara released in 2003, the film has become one of the project's canonical pieces of media, shared by the membership and forging an "imagined community", in Benedict Arnold's sense of the phrase (2006). _Crooked Beauty_ has been instrumental in communal workshop and educational settings, where screenings are followed by facilitated conversations, and it also functions well as a standalone work. It deserves a close study since it was deliberately crafted to distill the essence of the projects' values. A close analysis of the film in context provides us with a powerful lens for understanding the The Icarus Project's message and the emerging movement it signals.

\crookedimage{Fig01_cb_0064_Film_Poster.png}

The 30 minute film opens like a traditional documentary, with a medium close up shot of McNamara, narrating a poem:

\crookedimage{Fig02_cb_00_33_7_Head_Shot.png}


> _And that late afternoon sadness, rolls in like the luminous California fog, crossing over the hills._
> _And some part of me is convinced that I might have never really felt joy._

> _And yet there is a mythical quality to the garlic mustard, the afternoon, the angle of light that fills me with a peculiar, heartbreaking beauty._

> _And I wonder, as I often do, if things will ever be simple._

> _The train sounds down by the river._

> _The cloud passes over the sun._

> _And what could be memories feel like déjà vu._

> _Like they happened underwater a long time ago._ (0:11-0:49)

This is the only depiction of McNamara's "talking head" throughout the entire piece. In film studies, _mise-en-scène_ refers to "everything that goes into the composition of a shot – framing, movement of the camera and characters, lighting, set design and the visual environment, and sound." (Film Language Glossary, 2005). In a self-published essay about the conceptual and creative process of making _Crooked Beauty_, Rosenthal writes about his struggles with questions of representation and exploitation:

>How could I recount [their] troubled history with compassion rather than exploitation typical of films about mental illness?... How would we see Jacks onscreen? The traditional model of the featured character speaking to an off-screen interviewer felt contrived and inauthentic because it deferred to an unseen authority. So I began to think outside of representation and more about embodiment. What if I dispensed with a talking head altogether and found symbols for the face of 'madness'? (Rosenthal, 2010b).

Rosenthal constructs a cinematic language that immerses the audience in the moods, themes, and experiences McNamara narrates.

Explicitly leveraging film's primal relationship to light, he explores visual metaphors for "difference and conflict" in natural and urban landscapes. This imagery functions as visual counterparts to extreme moods and states of mind. The rhythm and pacing of his editing is accompanied by evocative sound effects (e.g. sprinklers, trains, rushing water) and a haunting original score. With the exception of the opening poem, the conscious decision to not show McNamara's face and body onscreen during their narration, in addition to silent, inter-titled segments, draws the audience into a first-person experience of the story.

\includegraphics{Fig03_cb_0521_title_card.png}

Such techniques are intended to create a space for McNamara's story to becomes the audiences' story, with McNamara listening to _us,_ acting as a shamanic guide through a cinematic vision quest. Listening closely, McNamara doesn't always speak strictly from the 'I'. They often seamlessly transitions into 'We' statements to emphasize their critiques and recommendations. Although there is an implied 'I think' or 'I believe' around all of their propositions, _Crooked Beauty_ is a film, not a support group. As a leader in an activist organization with years of experience running workshops and support groups, they are entitled to 'speak for' those whose trust they have earned. Through a piece of public media, they have the opportunity to extrapolate beyond their own experiences, channeling the community they helped build while speaking for them.

To analyze _Crooked Beauty's_ discursive style, I draw heavily on the primordial environment from which it sprung. The film organically absorbs and reflects The Icarus Project's values and aesthetics within its own poetic structure. _Crooked Beauty's_ particular formal structure is a powerful example of how storytelling can operate on multiple narrative levels simultaneously. The balanced interplay between contrasting narrative elements such as text/image, literal/metaphoric, personal/universal, mundane/metaphysical, illumination/shadow is articulated through cinema's fundamental grammar of light of dark.

A textual analysis of McNamara's story provides us with many traditional examples of the power of narrative. McNamara eloquently reframes the pathologizing master narratives that dominate the discourse around mental illness and wellness. Narrating the emotional crisis that led to their hospitalization, they explain:

\includegraphics{Fig04_cb_0343_prestigious.png}

>I went to a prestigious, private university. And at the time I was taking a class on the origin of life in the universe, and got totally convinced that if I could teach every high school student in America, that their bodies were made out of molecules that were born in the super novas of stars fifteen billion years ago, then we would all understand that we are all the same and there would be no injustice and no inequality and we would stop treating each other so badly. (Rosenthal, 2010a:5:22-5:44)

\includegraphics{Fig05cb_0378_total_expansion.png}\includegraphics{Fig06_cb_0387_cosmic_connections.png}

>And so I'd gone through a period of just total expansion and incredible energy, and so much insight. But insight at a level where I couldn't really connect with other people. Your brain takes off into this level of cosmic and cerebral connections but your heart isn't working quite right. And, you can connect fifty thousand ideas, but you can't listen to your friend talk about her relationship. (5:52-6:28)

\includegraphics{Fig07_cb_0396_divine_expanses.png}\includegraphics{Fig08_cb_0418_space_time.png}

>And so I went through a period which they would say is mania, all mental energy and connections and divine expanses of space and time and no grounding on the earth. And, then I crashed, really badly. And a lot of it for me was mixed up with drugs and alcohol. (6:30-6:46)

\includegraphics{Fig09_cb_0436_utter_despair.png}\includegraphics{Fig10_cb_0451_drugs_alcohol.png}

>I slipped into such a state of total and utter depression and despair that I didn't know what day it was, I didn't shower, I didn't change my clothes. I didn't really eat. Stopped going to school, stopped doing work, stopped going outside, stopped talking to people. Every time I tried to watch the television I was convinced that the world was ending and I would run out of the room screaming and shake and hide in the corner. And I was snorting Ritalin so I could write my final exam papers and then blacking out on the floor. Finally my girlfriend ended up calling up my parents, "I can't take care of your daughter anymore. (6:55-7:28)

\includegraphics{Fig11_cb_0459_daughter.png}

As a poet, McNamara has a deep understanding of how words convey different shades of meaning through inflection, connotation, and association. A cursory comparison with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders captures the contrast between a language of compassion and language of oppression. The DSM-IV-TR's definition of mania includes the following symptoms:

>(1) Elevated or expansive mood "characterized by unceasing and unselective enthusiasm for interacting with people", (2) Inflated self-esteem such as giving "advice on matters about which he or she has no special knowledge" or claiming a special relationship with God, (3) Speech that is loud, rapid, difficult to interrupt, and often "full of jokes, puns, plays on words, and amusing irrelevancies", (4) A flight of ideas "i.e., a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech, with abrupt changes from topic to topic, usually based on understandable relations", (5) Increased involvement in goal directed activity including "excessive planning of, and participation in, multiple activities (e.g., sexual, occupational, political, religious). (6) "God's voice may be heard explaining that the person has a special mission." (DSM-IV-TR, 2000)

It should be evident to any who consider these two descriptions side by side that both McNamara and the DSM both leverage the power of narrative. The DSM's point of view is difficult to discern, indeed the book's producers attempted to assert an objective view from nowhere (Lewis, 2006), until it is juxtaposed against the rich backdrop of McNamara's personal experience. Once we read an alternative description of similar behaviors, the blunt force of the diagnostic frame comes into clearer focus.

This comparison also demonstrates the power of inclusion and exclusion, as McNamara contextualizes their sensitivities against the backdrop of a cultural critique:

\includegraphics{Fig12_cb_0185_horse_fields.png}\includegraphics{Fig13_cb_0188_strip_malls.png}

>... I grew up in a region that was rapidly being developed and where, what used to be horse fields and meadows were being turned into strip malls, and condominiums, and corporate headquarters. Just watching the rape of this land... (3:00-3:13)

\includegraphics{Fig14_cb_0222_strappings.png}\includegraphics{Fig15_cb_0243_sprit_unity_freedom.png}

>I started to really lose interest in a lot of the trappings of popular culture. All these messages about the kind of person I was supposed to be. The world around me was way more interesting than a television show. And what everyone talked about on the bus to school was movies and celebrities and I just didn't care. I wanted to talk about like love and loss and life and the meaning of human existence and spirit and unity and freedom, and that's not what 12-year-olds were talking about... (3:28-4:02)

\includegraphics{Fig16_cb_0827_spirit_like_mine.png}\includegraphics{Fig17_cb_0835_capitalist_clock.png}

>If I was determined to live my life in a city and to work a really intensive, steady job in an office I think I would have to take medication to do that. But I don't think that fact means that I have a disease. I think that it means that it would take a pharmaceutical substance to override my instincts to make me capable of fitting into a system that was not designed for someone with a spirit like mine...

>I'm just really sensitive and my moods shift in ways that I don't really keep a rhythm that fits with the clock of capitalist society. (13:45-14:24)

\includegraphics{Fig18_cb_0842_rhythm.png}

In the course of narrating their story McNamara indicts capitalism, popular culture, the media, gentrification, urbanization, and the assumptions of the modern western lifestyle. The objectifying response they heard from psychiatry was "I'm a mood disorder with legs". Your life is insane because you have a biochemical problem. If you take these drugs religiously for the rest of your life, your life won't be insane." The ability to recognize the structural violence that McNamara feels oppressed by is entirely absent from psychiatry's response, again illustrating the power of framing, omission, and commission. We witness in this dialectic the forceful power of oppressive language, and the empowerment that comes from reclaiming languages of oppression. However, reclaiming this language still invokes it, and for many, healing involves supplanting this language with compassionate alternatives. _Crooked Beauty_ mobilizes this language of compassion to conjure authentic visions for thinking and speaking about "extreme states of consciousness".

McNamara claims "there would be a lot, a lot less mental illness, quote unquote, in our society if people were given spaces to work through emotions like anger and grief instead of denying them and suppressing them, if we had a language of compassion." (Rosenthal, 2010a) Rosenthal provides a cinematic space for McNamara to tell their story, and as we listen to them work through their emotions, both McNamara and Rosenthal attempt to model the language they imagine. Through screenings and workshops the film seeks to recreate this compassionate space, introducing an empowering new language, and then stepping back to give participants the communal space to reflect on their own emotions and experiences.

The alternative vision that McNamara promotes sounds simple and obvious, once articulated, but is tragically far from our current reality:

\includegraphics{Fig19_cb_0932.png}\includegraphics{Fig20_cb_0942.png}

>We need to stop saying, "You are crazy, stop being crazy." We need to stop putting all the focus and treatment on; How can we make you stop being the person you are? How can we stop telling you, that you are wrong if you experience these things? And how can we instead, help you to learn how to handle your sensitivities, that you might make the transition from having these sensitivities overwhelming you, to having these sensitivities be giving you information you can use? (15:40-16:12)

\includegraphics{Fig21_cb_0949.png}\includegraphics{Fig22_cb_1016.png}

Beyond the obvious advantages of framing, _Crooked Beauty_ also captures the paradoxical power of complexity and contradiction. Life is messy and complicated; to pretend that it isn't denies our humanity and reduces subjectivity to a multiple-choice survey. By embracing the contradictory emotions inevitable in a complex world, the film avoids the common pitfall of romanticizing illness and denying suffering. McNamara describes their initial reactions to their biochemical diagnosis:

\includegraphics{Fig23_cb_0586.png}\includegraphics{Fig24_cb_0591.png}

>Part of me really wanted an answer that left me off the hook as far as responsibility went. And being told that I had a mental illness was both horrifying and very conveniently left me out of responsibility for my life. And it enabled me to recast everything that had happened to me up to that point as a result of this mental illness. And part of me hated that and part of me was totally relieved. 'Cuz then it was just like, "Oh, that's why it's all been so hard. I've just got this brain disorder." But, I don't think that's actually the whole answer, at all. (9:40-10:16)

\includegraphics{Fig25_cb_0602.png}\includegraphics{Fig26_cb_0609.png}

Later, they elaborate on the beautiful and dark sides to all aspects of our reality – material, psychological, social, and metaphysical – and their ambivalence over their ability to acutely perceive and experience these extremes.

\includegraphics{Fig27_cb_1047.png}\includegraphics{Fig28_cb_1054.png}

>The dead flower over there and the shadow over here and this person over there and the love letter over there and the map over here and the apocalypse over there and Walmart down there and the ocean and the children and... and in my mind they're all connected. And they're not separable... (17:28-17:44)

\includegraphics{Fig29_cb_1067.png}\includegraphics{Fig30_cb_1088.png}

>I don't just see beauty and light and god and grass. I see suffering and bodies rotting in the streets and injustice and a lot of pain and terror and fear also comes in. 'Cause the dark side of humanity is very, very, very real. And we don't want to think about that. There's moments when people have glimpses of what is luminous and transcendent and that's fantastic, but no one stays there. (18:01-18:23)

\includegraphics{Fig31_cb_1142.png}\includegraphics{Fig32_cb_1196.png}

>God knows there have been more times in my life than I could ever count when I have been like please take this fucking thing away from me I don't want it. It is too painful, it is too much pain and suffering. You can have it back. Just let me close down and be like a normal person walking around the world. I don't want access to these frequencies. Can I please just shut the dial off? (18:29-18:52)

\includegraphics{Fig33_cb_1283.png}\includegraphics{Fig34_cb_1779.png}

"Lilies and urine"; expansion and contraction; transcendence and despair; beauty and darkness. Narratives are able to represent a continuous spectrum of perspectives that are difficult–if not impossible–to capture through ordinary propositional discourse. McNamara's narration relates the ambiguity of their situation, raises questions instead of making categorical assertions, and depicts how their perspectives oscillated and transformed over time and space. It is around the representation of ambiguity and contradiction, as well as voice, that the language of cinema helps amplify McNamara's story and transform it into a cinematic vision quest.

_Crooked Beauty_ embodies an emerging style of documentary filmmaking that blends and extends the boundaries of narrative advocacy and cinematic convention. The film is simultaneously an expression of hope and an act of resistance that powerfully captures a snapshot of the hierarchies of power in the domains of mental health and capitalist society at large. It defies many of the traditional sub-genres of documentary film – it cannot be easily categorized as historical, investigative, issue-oriented, ethnographic, or biopic. _Crooked Beauty_ poignantly refutes the prevailing medical gaze towards mental illness through an intensely personal narrative spoken over a backdrop of visually poetic imagery. The film's storytelling embodies a distinct perspective that provokes and challenges mainstream diagnostic paradigms. Its discursive style resonates deeply with the language, aesthetics, and values that have been painstakingly cultivated over the years by communities of radical mental health activists in peer-support groups and workshops across the country. This holographic work is simultaneously an expression of hope and an act of resistance, and can be read as a post-modern manifesto – one that often speaks from the subjective 'I's of personal experiences, and raises questions and contradictions instead of making grandiose assertions and categorical declarations.

The complex tensions created by these interwoven narrative threads contribute to _Crooked Beauty's_ captivating hold. The work is rich with contradiction and complexity, demanding and deserving multiple viewings to fully appreciate it. It is neither exactly McNamara's story, nor is it exactly not. Similarly, it is neither exactly the origin story of The Icarus Project, nor is it exactly not. The settings where the film has been distributed and screened also inform its reception. It has screened at multiple film festivals, often followed by a panel of Icarus members and/or the director to facilitate audience discussion. It has been distributed at Icarus events, and Icarus continues to develop supporting curricular materials. It is even being used in professional training settings to educate mental health practitioners. Its multi-dimensional style suggests a simultaneous reinvention of the documentary and the traditional manifesto.

Unlike mainstream documentaries that often talk _at_ the audience, _Crooked Beauty_ is designed as a space in which the audience can immerse themselves, and become narrators of their own stories, while employing McNamara's language of compassion. This is a grand ambition for a film as great cinema typically evokes admiration or contemplation, at best, and rarely such a degree of embodiment. Rosenthal's reciprocal technique is quite distinct from the conventions of mainstream storytelling, which are designed to provoke a compulsory identification with the protagonist, but not necessarily a first-person immersion in their experience. The line between identification and immersion is blurry, but Rosenthal's solution for avoiding the objectification or exploitation of his subject is to try to make them disappear, drawing the audience into the leading role. The viewer is meant to experience the emotional roller coaster the film for him/herself, beyond just identifying with Jacks. _Crooked Beauty_ employs the characteristically evocative power of poetry to transport the reader into the mindspace of the writer and directly experience McNamara's frame of mind. On occasions, especially when combined with a well facilitated, follow up workshop, _Crooked Beauty_ pulls off this feat.

Crooked Beauty's central position as a formative piece of media helping to represent, and in turn define, The Icarus Project is a function and a testament to this accomplishment. The film enacts the change it advocates by modeling a language of compassion and liberation. It exercises this language through the performance of authentic narratives and allegorical storytelling. It also reaches beyond the representation of the narrative, and attempts to embody the narrative through a series of immersive storytelling techniques. These immersive techniques are designed to take the audience on a phenomenological journey which tracks the narrator's experience, taking the viewer beyond identification towards a direct experience of the moods, themes, and feelings expressed in the film.

The audience responses to this film have been almost uniformly positive, and it has screened at almost thirty international film festivals, and has won over a dozen awards (Rosenthal, n.d.). Mental health professionals, academics, journalists, c/s/x/ activists as well as individuals struggling with their mental health have all found the film unique, provocative and powerful. I have participated in multiple workshops that opened with a screening of the film and participated in the conversations that followed. The film, combined with a skilled facilitator, helps create a conceptual clearing where people feel empowered to reclaim their own identities, to reevaluate the shame and stigma they feel about their own experiences, and even to try emancipating themselves from the alienation and isolation of psychiatry's dominant paradigm. A typical workshop engages the audience by asking them to share their own stories in response to the provocation of the film. Next, they separate into small groups and discuss questions such as "What am I like when I'm most alive?" "How do I know when I'm well?", and "What are the signs that you are struggling?." After a period of discussion, the groups reconvene and share the highlights of their conversations with the larger gathering. Often, remarkable patterns emerge that challenge the mainstream understandings of health and wellness. Participants described their newfound recognition for the power that labels and narratives wield in identity formation, and expressed how the film articulated ideas they have felt, but have been unable to put in words. These workshops would lead to the development of the ongoing Mad Maps project, described later in this chapter.

##Open Source, Open Minds##

The project's day-to-day practice was also embodied in The Icarus Project's digital infrastructure, and during periods when the leadership flourished, they deliberately chose tools supporting the project's participatory values and collective governance. From its inception, The Icarus Project was conceptualized as a network, with its web site operating as an inclusive communal hub, not just a broadcast transmitter. Interaction and participation were essential---The Icarus Project was not only curating and disseminating media stories, or connecting disjoint groups. The project aspired to democratize the production of psychiatric knowledge, and conceived of itself as an active listening space where the marginalized and their supporters would participate in sharing and exchanging their experiences, without judgment. At its best, the project has succeed in living up to this aspiration, although it has always struggled with stability---financial, organizational, and emotional. At other times, the site has functioned as the locus of conflict, or neglected to the point that there were barely enough resources and attention to pay the hosting provider and keep the domain name active.

The site was imagined as a space, not a wall or a billboard, and members actively embraced the discussion boards, and contributed user-generated content in the form of links, blogs, photos, and event postings. The project also collectively produced numerous zines, paraphernalia, artworks, podcasts, videos, and events. Through these prolonged discourses, people shared diverse narratives and invented new frames for talking about mental health. DuBrul and McNamara designed a platform for activists to speak directly to each other, and these personal encounters fostered collective empowerment and communal engagement. Regular art shows encouraged membership to submit their own artwork, which were in turn, featured and celebrated at local events and on the website galleries. _Friends Make the Best Medicine_,published in 2007,included a template and a call for readers to create their own local support groups, lightly coordinated though the public web forums(2007). Will Hall's _Madness Radio_ show regularly featured guests from the community, as well as journalists, activists and academics from across the movement. The first segment of the hour-long show was always devoted to the guests' personal story, told in their own words, with Hall's warm and compassionate interview style.

In 2003 DuBrul and McNamara wrote:

>We would like this site to become a place that helps people like us feel less alienated, and allows us, both as individuals and as a community, to tap into the true potential that lies between brilliance and madness. (DuBrul & McNamara, 2003)

At the outset, Icarus aligned itself with radical technology collectives, such as the Riseup.net collective and the May First/People Link. Unlike traditional hosting vendors, these organizations were devoted to social justice and independent media, and support a range of progressive activist organizations. These technical collectives managed the project's servers and mailing lists, providing secure hosting services that were organized like a cooperative instead of a corporation. These organizations strongly advocated for the use of free and open-source software (FOSS) based on their deep understanding of how these tools embodied the values of the causes they supported.

FOSS ecologies have been a breeding ground for experimenting with various models of structure and governance, promoting constructionist learning and civic engagement within communities of practice (Coleman, 2012). Since writing software is an act of creative expression, it is often the case that the artifacts created by a software community capture the values of that community through the inclusion (and omission) of the software's metaphors and features. The recursive questioning of process and structure is a habitual pattern of programmer's thinking, and it is no surprise to see this analytical gaze turned back on itself. The community's proximity to the architecture of their own communication channels encourages a reflexive attitude towards their own communicative superstructure, a communal disposition that the anthropologist Chris Kelty describes as a "recursive public" (Kelty, 2008).

Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, some members of The Icarus Project have recognized their deep ideological compatibility with free culture, and embraced FOSS tools and Creative Commons licensing at almost every turn. Although their original public-facing website was a custom proprietary implementation, the community forum was implemented using phpBB, a popular open source bulletin board system with flexible configuration that supported delegated moderation and pseudo-anonymous registration. The bulletin board software was deployed on an Icarus server, managed by May First, and Icarus had complete control over the software configuration and the data. The project went to great lengths to maintain civility on the discussion boards without instituting harsh, disciplinary tactics, such as banning. Volunteer moderators wrestled with this charge and worked heroically to facilitate discussions and mediate conflict. DuBrul describes the unique culture that developed in the forums:

>We were attracting interesting people. We had discussion forums with names like _Alternate Dimensions or Psychotic Delusions_ and _Give Me Lithium or Give Me Meth_. There was nowhere else around that was explicitly a place where people who used psych meds and people who did not and people who identified with diagnostic categories and people who did not could all talk with each other and share stories. Because of the outreach in the anarchist and activist community there was a high percentage of creative people with a radical political analysis. And with the (seeming) anonymity of the Internet, people felt comfortable being honest and sharing intimate stories about their lives. Our website served as a refuge for a diverse group of people who were learning the ways in which new narratives could be woven about their lives. (2012)

Icarus governance evolved into a hub-and-spoke model, with local autonomous spokes meeting in person, running peer-support groups, organizing events, talks, screenings, and teach-ins. The collective was able to intermittently raise infusions of funding which also supported operational costs, like hosting, office space, and minimal part-time salaries. The national collective relied heavily on tools like free conference calling, mailing lists, and especially wiki software to support transparency in their decision-making and leadership. For the period between 2004-2008, all of the national collective's meeting agendas, minutes, and finances were shared publically on project's organizing wiki and available to the membership for review. Support for this organizational model relied heavily on tools developed in the FOSS community, in this case OpenPlans.org, a suite of open-source organizing tools developed by a non-profit dedicated to using technology to improve the way citizens interact.

Icaristashave expressed a range of attitudes towards electronic communications---sometimes ambivalent, sometimes contradictory, sometimes hostile. There is a deep suspicion of digital communication, and many of the organizers express an aversion to screens and a strong preference for face-to-face communications. Some Icaristas engage the project exclusively online, others exclusively through face-to-face meetings and events, and some through a hybrid of online and in-person. The project has always been self-aware of the pitfalls of electronic communications, especially when negotiating conflict. In 2006 the collective published an "Email conflict Policy for Volunteers, Interns, and Staff" which stipulated:

>The Icarus Project supports direct and clear lines of respectful and supportive communication in the event of grievance, conflict, or interpersonal difficulty. Such communication is best done face to face, or, if face to face is not possible, on the telephone.

>No attempt should be made to resolve, process, debate or deal with interpersonal conflict issues of any kind over email. This includes discussion forums, instant messaging, chat rooms, blogs, commenting, etc.

>Attempts to resolve conflicts or grievances over email have consistently been shown not only to fail, but to make matters worse. Email is an impersonal and misleading medium that while helpful in rapidly transmitting information, promotes miscommunication, misunderstanding, mistrust and confusion when it comes to interpersonal conflict and difficulty. (2006c)

This email policy recognizes the shortcomings of digital communication that Rasmus Neilson identified in his research on the use of email in political organizing (2009). The policy extends his findings that email communications within a group often lead to "miscommunication, overcommunication and communication overload", and recognizes an additional emotional layer of mistrust characteristic of the medium. I have not seen this policy adopted elsewhere, and to my knowledge The Icarus Project originated this language, based on experience and necessity. As with The Icarus Project's meeting agreements described above, the email conflict policy is widely applicable beyond mental health organizing, and other groups should consider adopting it to help manage internal conflicts.

On numerous occasions, I have seen electronic conflicts averted as a participant or moderator linked to the email conflict policy. On many other occasions I have seen this policy flagrantly neglected or violated, often resulting in the outcomes it warns about. While this policy is difficult to enforce, at the very least it functions as an important reminder of the limitations of online peer-support forums, as experienced by the membership. Icaristas are a diverse group, with different backgrounds, priorities and communication styles. Conflicts erupt on a regular basis, group moderators work hard to mediate, and often burn out themselves in the process. Conflicts usually revolved around breakdowns in trust and miscommunication, and were exacerbated by the community's mad dispositions. Local groups were often wary of the national organizers, suspicious of information and community plans being withheld. As in any other community setting, gossip abounds, and mundane interpersonal conflicts spill over into community spaces. Few of the conflicts revolved specifically around mad issues, and most seemed typical of any activist community, at times amplified by the participant's sensitivities.

The intensity of the interactions was often striking, but their substance was fairly mundane. Disagreements over the substantive issues the group was advocating for were surprisingly civil, and pages of long-form, thoughtful, exchanges were common. Popular topics of discussion include questioning the value of medication, struggling with side-effects of medication, sharing alternative wellness practices, and coping with the stress of family, friends and employment. A fixture of the forums is the daily "Roll Call", a forum devoted to people greeting each other online every day. The value of this forum was best appreciated when the site experienced an outage in 2015, and the community was shocked and outraged.

It is one thing to recognize the pitfalls of electronic communication, and another thing altogether to transcend them. The realities of communication between and beyond Icaristas have presented extreme challenges. The project's self-awareness of these patterns feeds their continual efforts to improve these dynamics and break free of the repetition compulsion of these dramatic standoffs and implosions. Digital communications are fragile to start with, and their use within the project has only compounded the challenge. The national collective never developed a template or set of platform recommendations for local groups to follow, nor did they provide the infrastructure for local organizing, beyond the Forums, which were ill suited for sustained organizing and knowledge management. Groups were left to fend for themselves and for years wandered between a bewildering labyrinth of listservs, Yahoo! groups, Google groups, Facebook groups, even though many of these platforms were ill suited for these needs as well.

The national collective also cycled through patterns of communication breakdown. It seemed that just as the group had settled on one communication channel, the listserv was renamed, or the group decided to relocate. Bitrot, or, digital corrosion, was constantly nipping at the heels of the project, as their MySpace archives, numerous listservs, and content fell victim to deterioration in the course of upgrades and neglect.

In 2006, the public-facing website was rebuilt with Drupal, a FOSS content management system whose slogan is "Community Plumbing" and has a vibrant non-profit ecology. This new environment was intended to realize the original site's ambition of becoming a platform run by and for the membership. The site was designed to support distributed research across the community, as well as empower Icarus spokes with the tools they needed to organize locally. Although the Drupal site was successfully relaunched, the site's full capabilities were never realized. The national collective seemed stymied and blocked, and never took full advantage of the platform. These blocks may have been rooted in the challenge of generating fresh content rather than the technological hurdles, but for a variety of reasons the site never flourished. Funding shortages caught up to the project, and the membership was never trained on the site's new features. Significantly, around this time social networking platforms began competing for the attention of the membership.

At the time of this writing, the site is once again undergoing a major overhaul. In the past few years the project has been losing its control over the dynamics of the discussion as conversations have migrated to social networks like Facebook and Twitter. These proprietary platforms pose a grave threat to the project's autonomy and values. When activists organize on these platforms commercial interests dictate the contours of the conversational spaces, not the membership's needs. In particular, many of the dynamics of the original forums, including pseudo-anonymity, communal discretion over membership and content, and long-term control over archival records, will be lost unless the community returns to platforms that are under its autonomous collective ownership. The form of interactions on the PHPbb forums is dramatically different than those on Facebook. The forums regularly hosted sprawling, long-form debates, while Facebook interactions are staccato and terse. It is incredibly difficult to sift through Facebook archives, and once a conversation falls off the wall, it only exists in the memories of the participants. Forum conversations regularly referenced earlier posts, and some threads endured for months, or even years.

The drive to migrate is multi-fold. Over the past few years the rise in the popularity of Facebook, combined with the importance of mobile accessibility have pressured the project in this direction. A significant majority of the online participants access the site via their mobile devices, and the 2006 site was clunky and cumbersome, especially compared to the slick experiences of a modern social media site. Facebook also leverages powerful network effects, and since people are already spending large swaths of time on the platform it is much more convenient for them to interact there. According to Facebook's 2014 second quarter report, the average American spends 40 minutes per day on the site, a number that is certainly higher among the younger demographic makes up The Icarus Project (Brustein, 2014). The collective also grappled with the fact that an unofficial Facebook group would likely form if they did endorse one themselves.

In the winter of 2013 an incident occurred within The Icarus Project's official Facebook group that illustrates the threat posed by this loss of autonomy. In December 2011 Facebook introduced a tool that enables users to report their friend's comments as spam, bullying or suicidal (Donald, 2011). Users could "flag" a comment and submit their report to Facebook, whereupon Facebook employees review the comment to determine if it complies with Facebook's community standards. One morning in November 2013, a member of the Icarus Facebook group woke up to an email from Facebook administrators encouraging them to call the national suicide hotline, without disclosing who had submitted the report about their comment. The recipient of this email experienced the message as cold and coarse, and immediately returned to the Icarus Facebook group and accused its members of snitching on them. The Icarus members all denied reporting the comment, and wondered if friends from a different Facebook group might have been responsible.

The national suicide hotline has a reputation within the Icarus community for strongly endorsing the biomedical model and erring on the side of caution by forcefully encouraging medication compliance and summoning law enforcement to hospitalize the caller whenever there is any doubt. Icarus peer-support meetings have long practiced non-judgmental, active listening and most of the membership is fiercely opposed to the violence inherent in forceful coercion. Icaristasgenerally believe that sharing suicidal ideations is healthy and therapeutic, and the fear of being reported will inhibit people's willingness to share. Icarus peer-support groups have a long history of creating relatively safe-spaces where people feel confident that sharing their darkest fantasies will not result in calls to authorities, followed by the inevitable involuntary hospitalization and treatment (with rare exceptions, under the most extreme circumstances). Facebook's architecture violated some of the most basic shared values of the group.

After days of heated discussions, the group moderators began to preemptively delete comments that might be construed as suicidal. This adaptation is the response to what was described as an "absurdly coarse policy" that "fails to recognize diversity and context". In the summer of 2014, the group has begun discussing a Facebook exodus and a return to the Icarus managed forums. The situation is complicated since the people that remained on the Forums are wary of welcoming a massive influx of Facebook members, and it is currently unclear what platform will support group discussions moving forward, or if the discussion environments will begin operating independent of the Icarus collective and become self-governing.

This incident of reporting a suicidal post on Facebook was not an isolated occurrence. Rather, it illustrates how embracing proprietary corporate tools can lead to environments that are deeply at odds with the project's core values. One Icarista I spoke with discussed his fears of honestly sharing his dark feelings on Facebook since he was "friends" with his family, and did not trust Facebook's privacy settings. There are even stories of Icarus members being hospitalized on the basis of their Facebook posts, and more are sure to surface. One Icarista I know shared with me that her high frequency updates, and the erratic times of day they were posted, was used by her parents as evidence to her psychiatrist that she had relapsed to an "altered state", leading to her re-hospitalization. She claimed that the content of her updates was not all that strange, but the timestamps betrayed that she was not sleeping. While it is possible that posts to the Icarus forums could have been used in a similar fashion, the Icarus-controlled forums do not require that people use their real names, and are generally a much safer space for sharing fears and dark fantasies, with an expectation that people will actively listen without judging. Only when the project directly controls its communications software does the membership have the freedom to decide for themselves how to moderate and surveil their own spaces.

Over the past decade The Icarus Project has gravitated to media that are consistent with their core values of transparency, empowerment and participation. From their in-person participatory workshop formats to the Kickstarter campaigns that have funded their collectively authored zines, the project has systematically attempted to emphasize the importance of incorporating the voices of their membership directly in their messages. Even the forays into platforms like Facebook, which is at odds with these convictions, has highlighted the project's commitments against the backdrop of tensions that emerged around its use. The relationship between a group's core values, organizational structure, and communications infrastructure is always complex, but we can clearly see strong correlations between these three pillars. The project's politics are enacted in the ways it acts and communicates, and the deliberate selection of distributed, participatory media reflects a fundamental commitment to the principle "Nothing about us, without us". These communicative modalities operationalize the ways that "us" can be present and express their voices.

##The Problems in \'the\' Movement##

In May 2013, Nev Jones, a doctoral candidate in community psychology, published a blog post on the problems inside the mad movement. (Jones, 2013) This post generated a great deal of debate across the c/s/x movement, and the Icarus Facebook group alone generated hundreds of responses to this post. Threads of this length and intensity are a regular occurrence within the Icarus forums and Facebook group, and I have selected to analyze this exchange since it does not involve anyone's personal condition and also does and excellent job surfacing some of the core issues the project is currently negotiating. The thread is representative of the tone and style of exchange across a wide range of issues, and my inclusion of this debate provides a sampling of the texture of these conversations.

The post critiqued the larger mad movement's leadership, organizational structure and contradictory politics. Jones begins:

>[I do not know of] one national user/survivor organization... with a transparent, robustly democratic organizational structure: at the extremes, some organizations that (explicitly or implicitly) claim to 'represent' a national constituency do not even publicly list the names of their leaders, administrators or board members. There are no elections, and sometimes absolutely no way for 'outsiders' to get involved even as volunteers. Little or no attention is paid to widespread geopolitical disparities, to the de facto silencing of service user voices in huge swathes of the country, or to the trickle-down effects of SAMSHA [the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration] funding (or the lack thereof) [the bulk of SAMSHA's funding is administered through block grants, which are in turn, dispensed by individual States], which remains largely contingent on the presence of "statewide" consumer networks which many states do not have in place (no matter how dense or active the smaller groups within these states).

>A handful of SAMSHA Technical Assistance Centers exercise more or less exclusive control over the only "national" US c/s/x conference (Alternatives), and other 'events' and gatherings are by and large 'by invitation only,' further consolidating the power of small and select 'insider' networks."

>A curious combination of anti-intellectualism and anti-empiricism seems to fuel such 'lines of flight'; apparent, for example, in the simultaneous valorization of 'good' science (viz. "science" that matches particular ideological positions regardless of the methods employed) and disregard for the transdisciplinary cultural and political complexities of all knowledge production and dissemination. If financial 'conflicts of interest' are an issue in the world of Big Pharma, they are no less an issue (albeit on a vastly smaller scale) in the increasingly commodified world of training packages and patented interventions (e.g. OpenDialogue [an alternative, dialogue-based approach to psychosis interventions, developed in Finland (Intervoice, 2013)]). (Jones, 2013)

Some of the initial, knee-jerk reactions to the post were defensive, and some attacked Jones for her jargon-filled academic language and simplified her position as an anti-anti-psychiatrist and sympathizer with the biomedical model.

>Icarista01:I don't see this author's appraisal existing within that "grey zone" of auto-critique and meaningful dialogue that they praise. Their own biases and unquestioned assumptions are clear as day in this piece. For example, in this quote: "truly "chronic" problems are either explained away as casualties not of madness but rather overmedication and iatrogenic trauma" they frame the biopsych perspective as absolute fact ("truly") and the antipysch perspective as simply dodging those facts ("explained away"). Throughout the piece they slap a "problematic" label on various things with little explanation or attempt to back it up. This piece lacks substance and just looks to me like the tl;dr [too long, don't read] version of an "amirite, guys?" to the consumer crowd. I have frequently seen (and see reflected in this piece) a sense of entitlement coming from those whose belief system is more closely aligned with the mainstream --- a smug belief that their perspective is the gold standard of uncontestable fact, that the burden of proof rests on anyone deviating from such, and that no perspective can be "nuanced" or "complex" unless it includes or validates theirs in some way.

As the thread progressed, some others urged a closer reading, especially after people discovered Jones' personal identification as a mad activist and voice hearer with a schizophrenic diagnosis.

>Icarista02: I'm going to do my best to say a few things about this in a non-polarizing way, cause these comment threads too often lead to that. First, I basically agree completely with the blog post, however I do not agree with how it is framed in some of the above responses. The post is not pro-Pharma, nor is it coming from a 'consumer' as apposed to a 'radical' perspective. In fact, part of the point of the post is to reject that dichotomy. There are not 2 or 3 perspectives in "c/s/x" or "mad" or "radical mental health activism," there are many. In the case of the blog, I would suggest considering the source-a completely credible radical mental health activist and researcher with (also credible) lived experience of madness and the system. I would also suggest considering the audience. That is, 'us.' People involved in 'radical' mental health activism. She is objecting to within movement issues, and they are quite serious concerns, ones related to things that I would hope any 'radical' identified person would be open to hearing: silencing dissent, appropriation of mad identities for profit, consolidation of power, representing marginalized others from a place of privilege while discrediting their experience, etc. I would say the Icarus Project, if it's anything like it used to be, would be right on board with this. After all, Icarus was 'grey' back in the day.

Throughout the thread Icarista02 patiently tried to explain Jones' position against an initially stark rejection. However, even Jones' invocation of personal stories within the movement was criticized on the grounds that she mobilized these stories for a utilitarian purpose:

>Icarista03: I very much enjoy hearing people's personally stories, whatever shape their stories has. But I like it as long as it is deeply human, as me, human, getting to know another human. I don't like to listen to listen to personal stories as some sort of utilitarian or intellectual exercise to achieve conclusions that are outside the person, to analyze the person in ways that i think will ultimate benefit/validate or agree with me. I find it very dehumanizing and degrading. I enjoy intellectualism, but certainly not that flavor of it. I also find disagreement to be a beautiful thing, because disagreement births multiple ideas and multiple places where a variety of people can find 'home' or 'help' or whatever it is they are looking for, so I don't necessarily think that should be the end goal of conversations or practices.

The debate over the connotations of "chronic" conditions continued:

>Icarista01:to respond to your comments to me from earlier: I think you missed my point. "Truly chronic" is a de facto endorsement of biopsychiatry because it implies a permanent biological disorder. You're doing the same thing Nev [Jones] did, basically stating this as an absolute fact of reality when really you have no way of knowing that --- not for yourself, not for your mother, not for anyone.

>Icarista02: I truly apologize if my careless use of language caused offense. This format is an inherently dehumanizing way to communicate. this was not my intention.As to 'chronicity,' I think it's not in touch with the reality of many peoples lives to not acknowledge that these difficulties are inherently a part of the person, biological or otherwise. As to disorder, that is socially defined. We acknowledge eye color is genetic, but not a disorder.

>Icarista04: damn this is a debate. really appreciating everyone's comments. I really disagree with this statement: " "Truly chronic" is a de facto endorsement of biopsychiatry because it implies a permanent biological disorder." I do not think that saying someone's distress recurs means it is in any way inherently biological, or a disorder. My distress has certainly turned out to be chronic, no matter how many non-pharmaceutical treatment alternatives or lifestyle changes I have made. (And I have tried SO MANY.) It comes back and comes back and comes back, in small micro-storms I can navigate, and in huge episodes that wreck my entire life. I don't think that means I have a biological disorder, but I do not identify with all the linear recovery stories, the narratives that say it is all caused by psychiatry or all caused by the meds, or with the political rhetoric that minimizes actual experiences of madness. I do not feel like my experience is at all included in the narratives so popular right now on places like Mad in America and Madness Radio that so often focus only on recovery from first break "psychosis" or single episode depression, that therefore debunk research only specifically around anti-psychotics and anti-depressants, etc, but don't look at things on the bipolar spectrum. It's so much more complicated when your shit recurs over and over, and when in your experience mood stabilizers help and prevent crises and are not a fucking placebo - but when you go look at media produced by some of the top movement critics - Peter Breggin's [a staunch anti-psychiatrist] toxic psychiatry website, for example, there's nothing on mood-stabilizers and anti-convulsants. Clink on those links and they're empty. Bob Whitaker doesn't write about them either.

The chorus of support continued to gain volume:

>Icarista04: Once I felt like I was duped by psychiatry because I listened to anti-psychiatry. Then I felt like I was duped by anti-psychiatry... Now I don't listen to any extreme, but the shame never goes away... I'm a survivor of the system and of mental illness too... I had periods where I've been jobless, friendless, no support from family, homeless, hungry, tortured and really fucking crazy to the point of putting myself and others in danger... On medication I'm at least stable enough to not be constantly tormented inside... Do the medications have dangers?... Pharma would have me believe those dangers are nothing and anti-pharma would have me believe my head's going to explode tomorrow. I'm right now making an informed choice to be on medication... That's based on my past actual states of mind and behavior (and the police arriving at the right time), not just conjecture... From my perspective, both "sides" of this thing are doing it wrong and both have considerable persuasive power in their own way.

But these arguments would never convince the die-hard psychiatric survivors in the group, who continued to stick to their dogma:

>Icarista05: "Mental illness does not exist" is not a line, it is not a move in a parlor game to be played by postmodern intellectuals. It reflects an existential position about what it means to be a human being. After a few years of working in the mental death system I realized–I was too stupid to see sooner– that the mental illness attribution was the most powerful way to invalidate people as human beings. Anyone who was once ever a patient (as I was–in therapy) ought to know that.. You've convinced yourself now it's just "a line." Did you forget how important it once was to you to be taken as seriously as everyone else, how discrediting it was to be dismissed as schizophrenic or bipolar or whatever?

Discussions like this are typical within the Icarus community, and diverse and contradictory views are cultivated and developed. This thread never came to a resolution, although the insight around the prevalent "first break" narrative would resurface in later conversations. Contradiction, reflection and critique are the norm as diverse beliefs clash and coalesce. Sometimes people's positions soften and change. Other times they remain steadfast and resolute. What is most notable is that a space has been cleared that is tolerant of differing positions where people are generally respectful to each other, with some exceptions. They are committed to listening to and learning from each other's wisdom, especially when it was gleaned through personal lived experience. These conversations are often highlighted and synthesized in the group's publications, which are published in the form of newsletters, articles and zines.

#Addendum: Mad Maps#

The Icarus Project is currently focusing on a major new initiative to develop a set of resources designed to help people create their own personal tools for self-care and peer-based support. This effort is a direct continuation of the project's initial vision, and has developed out of workshops, personal practices, and hardened experience.

>For many years, members of The Icarus project have been imagining maps and roads and labyrinths that would lead us in our journey and ground us in the moment. These have been called "wellness maps" or "mad maps" – reminder documents we create for ourselves and the people around us about our wellness goals, warning signs, strategies for health and who we trust to look out for our best interests when we're not at our best. (The Icarus Project, 2013)

The project explicitly recognizes the authority of individuals to recognize and determine their own health and well being. In workshops conducted in 2014-15, participants were invited to describe the conditions and behaviors they associate with their own wellness, as well as their own struggles. These responses are being collected and curated into what can be thought of as the "people's DSM". In other words, the behaviors and coping mechanisms as described by the people experiencing, and sometimes struggling with, extreme states of consciousness will be indexed and cataloged into an interactive resource. The intent of this resource is to allow individuals to share and exchange their experiences, in their own words in the hope that their experiences will resonate with others. The emphasis on "grounding us in the moment" parallels the emphasis on "speaking from the I", as participants are encouraged to focus on the present, and avoid excessive preoccupations with the past or the future. In contrast to the cold and clinical diagnostic language of the DSM, the Mad Maps project is about trying to develop new ways of talking about mental health and wellness that resonate with the lived experiences of Icaristas.

#Virtual Phenomenologic Interventions#

The preceding thick descriptions of The Icarus Project help locate the project in the context of its forerunners. Experiments like R.D. Laing's Kingsley Hall (Laing, 1971) and Loren Mosher's Soteria Houses (Mosher, 1999) were intended to promote healing and liberation though the ethos of peer-support and mutual-aid, although they did not go as far to challenge hierarchy and promote horizontal equality. These experiments, with all of their blemishes and failures, represent alternative treatment regimes for acute emotional crises and can be viewed as antecedents to the Icarus approach of healing by-, and through-, participation within a therapeutic community.

In his description of Kingsley Hall, a community center in East London that Laing converted in 1965 to a non-restraining, non-drugging schizophrenic treatment experiment. Laing writes: "Events have included painting, weaving, yoga, poetry readings, Indian temple dancing, exhibitions, films, and lectures on anthropology, psychiatry, the theater, etc.... Many people visited the Hall. Those living there, decided who they wished to see." (Laing, 1971:60) This vision of Kingsley Hall is sharply challenged by the version depicted in _Zone of the Interior_, a thinly disguised fictional account of Kingsley Hall written by its co-founder, Clancy Sigal (1976). In this account, Sigal paints a much starker picture of disconnects between Kingsley Hall's vision and its operation. Patients were neglected, drugged and abused, and Laing's megalomania was laid bare. After many reports of harassment from the local community, the project was shut down in 1970. Visitors to the hall included celebrities such as Timothy Leary, Allen Ginsberg and the Beatles, and often involved LSD experiments designed to help participants "break through".

The Soteria method (from the Greek \emph{$\Sigma\omega\tau\eta\rho\acute{\iota}\alpha$} for "salvation" or "deliverance"), resembled Laing's Kingsley House, but was founded in America in 1971, and was not associated with psychedelics. Mosher describes the foundation of the method as follows:

>Basically, the Soteria method can be characterized as the 24 hour a day application of interpersonal phenomenologic interventions by a nonprofessional staff, usually without neuroleptic drug treatment, in the context of a small, homelike, quiet, supportive, protective, and tolerant social environment. The core practice of interpersonal phenomenology focuses on the development of a nonintrusive, non-controlling but actively empathetic relationship with the psychotic person without having to do anything explicitly therapeutic or controlling. In shorthand, it can be characterized as "being with," "standing by attentively," "trying to put your feet into the other person's shoes," or "being an LSD trip guide" (remember, this was the early 1970s in California). The aim is to develop, over time, a shared experience of the meaningfulness of the client's individual social context---current and historical.

Note, there were no therapeutic "sessions" at Soteria. However, a great deal of "therapy" took place there as staff worked gently to build bridges, over time, between individuals' emotionally disorganized states to the life events that seemed to have precipitated their psychological disintegration. The context within the house was one of positive expectations that reorganization and reintegration would occur as a result of these seemingly minimalist interventions. (1999:146)

These descriptions bear a strikingly similarity to DuBrul and McNamara's initial visioning statement:

>... While many of us use mood-stabilizing drugs like Lithium to regulate and dampen the extremes of our manias and the hopeless depths of our depressions, others among us have learned how to control the mercurial nature of our moods through diet, exercise, and spiritual focus. Many of us make use of non-Western practices such as Chinese medicine, Yoga, and meditation. Often we find that we can handle ourselves better when we channel our tremendous energy into creation: some of us paint murals and write books, some of us convert diesel cars to run on vegetable oil and make gardens that are nourished with the waste water from our showers. In our own ways we're all struggling to create full and independent lives for ourselves where the ultimate goal is not just to survive, but to thrive. (2002)

While the outcomes of the Kingsley Hall and Soteria experiments are still hotly disputed, some clear limitations of these earlier models are challenges with sustainability and difficulty scaling. Kingsley Hall hosted a total of 119 people between 1965 and 1970 (Laing, 1971), and each of the Soteria house cohorts numbered in the dozens (Matthews et al., 1979). In 2008, The Icarus Project website hosted five thousand unique visitors a month and maintains an active membership mailing list of over four thousand emails. An open challenge for The Icarus Project is overcoming the problem of sustaining a community over time that Soteria houses have historically struggled.

More significant than the quantitative scale of these interventions, digital media facilitates the creation of alternative spaces through the inherent malleability of software (Manovich, 2001). In a virtual environment, the architectural constraints that influence the social dynamics of a community are actualized through software interfaces. As we have seen above, free and libre open-source software systems are especially well suited to the design of environments that cut against the mainstream. A virtual Soteria house would be difficult to maintain within the Facebook platform, alongside pharmaceutical advertisements and within an inherently volatile and insecure privacy setting. In contrast, The Icarus Project has recreated the essence of the Soteria house's phenomenological interventions through a hybrid online/offline networks organized around their shared multimedia publications and exchanges. Crucially, The Icarus Project extends the Soteria model by constructing a context where people who are not contending with an acute crisis can plan and organize. This model encourages experimentation that blends Soteria's peer-support model with traditional activism and protest.

David Graeber's formulation of direct action is also helpful in theorizing The Icarus Project's contrast with the psychiatric survivor movements that preceded it.

The reason anarchists like direct action is because it means refusing to recognize the legitimacy of structures of power. Or even the necessity of them. Nothing annoys forces of authority more than trying to bow out of the disciplinary game entirely and saying that we could just do things on our own. Direct action is a matter of acting as if you were already free. (Evans and Moses, 2011)

Instead of exclusively protesting egregious abuses of institutional power, The Icarus Project activists, like the Soteria houses before them, assert their freedom by constructing and inhabiting the alternative worlds they envision. They explicitly struggle with the legitimacy of the structures of power that regulate their own organization, almost to a fault. The project's preoccupation with its own governance structure has been criticized as self-indulgent. The project has also been accused of being organizationally unaccountable, since they lack a traditional non-profit structure, with a well defined membership and board. Acting as if they are free may in fact be a euphemism for acting childishly, an essential aspect of the romance and the "uncivilizing" argument that Fletcher ascribes to the project in her dissertation (2015). 

The Icarus Project thrives when practicing peer-support, offering emotional first-aid, and caring for each other's basic needs. The project offers us a glimpse of alternatives to both mainstream biopsychiatry and 20th century psychiatric resistance. The psychiatric survivors' defiant rhetoric paradoxically reinforces the mainstream psychiatric frame by speaking for others and dictating how they should narrate their own experiences. For Icaristas_,_ radical mental health is about interconnectedness, diversity, embodied expertise, options, and politics. Community functions as the antidote to stigma, diffusing the isolation and alienation perpetuated and reinforced by a cold and inhumane system. The idea that community, peer-support, and mutual aid foster healing is barely acknowledged by the mainstream discourse.

#Conclusion#

The field of mental health is undergoing rapid shifts along with most other fields of society and sectors of the economy. These revolutions are happening concurrently with our transition to a networked society, and it is tempting to claim that the Internet has given rise to one emerging practice or another. However, when considering the influence of communications tools on social movements it is crucial not to fetishize technology. At the same time, it is foolish to ignore it or dismiss its impact.

In this chapter, instead of asking how the Internet has shaped The Icarus Project's communicative practices, I investigated their communications through a range of media. Although DuBrul does not enumerate participatory web culture as one of the original influences on The Icarus Project (2012), the Internet's capabilities are implied by the group's initial manifestation as a web site. The Icarus Project's longstanding slogan, "You Are Not Alone" is an undertaking that can only be fully realized in a networked society, where the web allows the long-tail of the neurologically diverse to locate each other and organize more easily than ever before in human history. The plummeting costs of production and distribution have enabled a range of independent publications, from books, to radio shows, to documentaries that, until recently, would be nearly impossible to produce without access to large amounts of capital. This media allows activists to talk back to psychiatry, promotes a diversity of voices, and galvanizes communities around issues and protests.

Perhaps the most promising and elusive potential of these shiny new tools lies in their capacity to help activists manifest their visions, and sidestep protest through the construction of alternative worlds. Once built, these same activists now face the struggle of sustaining these worlds, often requiring far more energy than their initial creation. A history of convulsions, implosions, and disintegrations has plagued The Icarus Project, similar to the way it has plagued Soteria houses before it. Perhaps the ease of creating worlds only serves to amplify the effort required to sustain them. The proliferation of communicative modalities can lead to a cacophony of voices, unless there is an organizing principle, sometimes embodied in strong leadership, to harmonize them.

Most significantly, this investigation traces the contours of a profound transition in psychiatric resistance. The Icarus Project represents a new wave of resistance, one that shifts from the ontological questions of the definition of disease and illness to the epistemological questions of whose stories and voices are considered in the production of psychiatric knowledge. This insistence on full-fledged participation in one's own healing, and more importantly, in healing by and through community, represents a new modality of protest joined to an alternative vision, one that goes beyond the discourse of human rights and individual choice. It is a modality of protest that meshes well with our "decentralized networked-era culture" and offers a path for taking direct action in the context of mental health.

As we have seen, there is no singular set of demands that Icaristas are making on psychiatry. The unifying principle is their demand to participate in the production of psychiatric knowledge---to have a say in their own diagnosis, treatment and most importantly ownership over their own personal narrative. The Icarus Project is a space of experimentation, a clearing outside of the mainstream where people are beginning to redefine mental wellness, and are treating each other the way they want to be treated. In some respects the project is focused on creating alternatives that sidestep direct confrontation with the system. Icaristas are creating the kinds of spaces and protocols they would like to see in the world, prior to attempting to integrate these alternatives with mainstream psychiatry. From this perspective, The Icarus Project is currently concerned with setting its own table, rather than demanding a voice at anyone else's. Once this table is set, and people are nourished, they will be in a much stronger position to engage with the psychiatrists, CEOs, and politicians dining at the other tables of power.
