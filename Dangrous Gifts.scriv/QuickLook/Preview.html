Over the past decade the politics and rhetoric of activists organizing around mental health issues have begun to shift dramatically. These shifts have been simultaneously subtle and stark. Crucially, some elements of the movement have moved away from a purely oppositional, head-butting critique of the psychiatric-pharmaceutical alliance, and their demands have begun to focus on questions of voice. In the tradition of the disability rights movement, this new generation ...</p>

The psychiatric-pharmaceutical establishment rarely acknowledges these challenges to their authority, but their messaging reinforces and relies on the validity of a form of scientific objectivity that can definitely distinguish between sickness and health.

Zooming in from these broad highlights on the workings of the pharmaceutical industry, this past decade has witnessed a profound shift in our collective judgment of behavior in children in the U.S., as childhood and risk itself are increasingly pathologized.

My personal engagement with The Icarus Project began in Winter 2005 when I encountered a journalism student's article in the Columbia News Service entitled "A new movement views bipolar disorder as a dangerous gift" (Itzenson, 2005). Itzenson's article spotlighted The Icarus Project, and characterized the project as pioneering a new movement, more nuanced and ambig...</p>

In January 2007 I personally became a client of the EFF and agreed to have them represent me against Lilly and defend my right to speak. The circumstances of this case converged around my intellectual and activist passions. At this point in my life I was an active supporter of the EFF, and active in the "free culture" movement, a direct descendant of the free speech movement and was becoming more engaged in psychiatric resistance. As a part of this action I also chose to exercise my...</p>

<br/>
These experiences led me to view the work of the Icarus Project in a fresh light. The ZyprexaKills campaign opened my eyes to the changing landscape of mental health treatment, and I became more conscious of the corruption and largely unchecked power of the pharmaceutical industry alongside their peculiar alliance with psychiatry. This alliance is one of the factors standing in the way of involving patients in knowledge making, and psychiatrists, journalists, and patients al...</p>

<br/>
A vivid way to illustrate the generative and explanatory power of this rhetorical frame is by considering a series of recent developments and analyzing them though this lens. These examples are drawn from ongoing conversations on the future of mental health, and represent different vectors of attack that the mainstream psychiatric establishment is facing.<br/>

<br/>
>_Is it possible to go mad in a positive way? How would you create a safe place in which to do so? If you designed your own asylum, what would it look like?_<br/>
<br/>
These are the questions motivating "MADLOVE: A Designer Asylum", an innovative art project-cum-intervention that previewed in Liverpool, England in the Spring of 2015. The project is compelling since it demonstrates an act of resistance that does not demonize psychiatry or condemn asylums outright. Rather, i...</p>

In 2014 the British Psychological Society, a professional association representing psychologists and psychology in in the UK, published a controversial report entitled "Understanding Psychosis and Schizophrenia". The report acknowledges the role of trauma, abuse or deprivation in the development of extreme experiences, talks about the advantages and disadvantages in calling these experiences symptoms of mental illness, and emphasizes the role of talking treatments in...</p>

On March 7, 2015 I attended a lecture given by Mark Solms, PhD entitled "Neuropsychoanalysis:  Dangers and Opportunities" at NYU's School of Medicine (Solms, 2015). Over one-hundred people attended the lecture, and the lecture hall was literally standing room only. Solms is part of an emerging movement to incorporate psychoanalysis into the study of neuroscience, and his talk was aimed at a general audience and was not focused specifically on pathologi...</p>

Recognition at the tables of power is only a precondition for the kinds of changes in treatment, attitude and policy that the movement would like see emerge. What might the regime of mental health look like if the activists prevailed? What would victory look like and what issues might displace the current priorities? What are the stakes of these showdowns and how do they intersect with broader trends in advocacy for social justice, freedom and equality?<br/>

<br/>
The most important undertaking for the movement right now is the creation of positive alternatives. Without these alternatives, even well intentioned authorities have little recourse when faced with personal crisis. Establishing projects and programs that embody the values and priorities of the movement will help advance the agenda through demonstration and performative critique.<br/>

Numerous leaders in the mental health reform movement have called for a focus on the creation of t...</p>

In 1998 the American Legacy Foundation (ALF) was established as a part of the settlement agreement between the states and the tobacco industry. ALF is the largest non-profit public health organization in the US and is dedicated to tobacco control. The organization funds campaigns and educational initiatives to help reduce smoking and counters the marketing engine of the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry betrayed everyone's trust with decades of toxic cover ups and lies, and th...</p>
